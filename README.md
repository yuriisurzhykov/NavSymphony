# NavSymphony

**NavSymphony** is a highly flexible, declarative navigation framework for **Jetpack Compose** applications. It was designed for complex, stateful, policy-driven applications such as OEM, kiosk-mode, or enterprise systems, where navigation must be validated, restricted, or adapted dynamically at runtime.

---

## üöÄ Overview

NavSymphony extends the traditional idea of Jetpack Navigation by introducing **intent-driven navigation**, **requirements validation**, and **menu-aware graph composition**.

Instead of pushing destinations directly, navigation occurs through structured **intents**. Each intent passes through a chain of **validators** that can authorize, redirect, or ignore the request based on runtime conditions.

The result: predictable, secure, and extensible navigation ‚Äî controlled from a single source of truth.

---

## üß© Key Features

* **Declarative Graph DSL** ‚Äî Define screens, menus, and non-menu screens with appearance and timeout policies.
* **Requirements System** ‚Äî Define per-screen access requirements (authentication, permissions, etc.) validated before navigation.
* **Intent Validation Chain** ‚Äî Chain multiple validators with deterministic priority to intercept or redirect intents.
* **Timeouts & Policies** ‚Äî Add per-screen or inherited timeouts with automatic logout or redirect.
* **Overlay Navigation** ‚Äî Unified management for dialogs, progress windows, and modal overlays.
* **Composable ViewModel Navigation** ‚Äî ViewModels initiate navigation via typed intents, keeping UI decoupled from navigation logic.
* **Safe Graph Evolution** ‚Äî Built-in validation prevents duplicate routes, missing validators, or invalid configurations.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Example Usage

### 1. Define Navigation Graph

```kotlin
val appGraph = graph {
    screen<HomeScreenRoute> {
        appearance = NodeAppearance.Primary
        timeout = 10.minutes
        require(AuthRequirement())
    }

    menu<SettingsMenuRoute> {
        items {
            screen<NetworkSettingsRoute> {
                require(ProtectedAreaRequirement())
            }
            screen<AboutAppRoute>()
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Add Custom Requirement

```kotlin
class AuthRequirement : NavigationRequirement {
    override val key = "auth:loggedIn"
}

class AuthValidator : IntentValidationChain, PrioritizedValidator {
    override val priority = 0

    override suspend fun validate(intent: NavigationIntent, node: NavigationNode): ValidationResult {
        return if (SessionManager.isLoggedIn()) ValidationResult.Valid
        else ValidationResult.Redirect(AppNavigationIntent.NavigateTo(LoginScreenRoute()))
    }
}
```

### 3. Trigger Navigation from ViewModel

```kotlin
class LoginViewModel : NavigationViewModel<LoginScreenState, LoginIntent>(...) {

    override fun processIntent(intent: LoginIntent) {
        when (intent) {
            is LoginIntent.Submit -> {
                if (authRepository.login(intent.credentials)) {
                    launchNavigation(AppNavigationIntent.NavigateTo(HomeScreenRoute()))
                } else {
                    displayOverlay(LoginFailedDialog())
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Display a Progress Dialog

```kotlin
val dialog = ProgressDialogWindow(
    messageResolver = StringResolver.from(R.string.message_connecting),
    dismissEnabled = false
)

viewModel.displayOverlay(dialog)
```

### Components

| Component                   | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NavigationGraph**         | Root structure that defines all available screens and menus.                                 |
| **NavigationNode**          | Represents a single screen or menu item, including metadata and policies.                    |
| **NavigationChoreographer** | Core engine responsible for handling navigation intents and producing commands.              |
| **IntentValidationChain**   | Set of interceptors that validate, modify, or redirect navigation.                           |
| **NavigationRequirement**   | Declarative condition that a node must satisfy before being opened.                          |
| **NavigationViewModel**     | Base ViewModel with built-in navigation helpers (e.g. `launchNavigation`, `displayOverlay`). |
| **OverlayManager**          | Manages modal windows (dialogs, progress, confirmation, etc.) as part of navigation.         |

---

## üß† Validation System

Every navigation action (intent) passes through the **IntentValidationChain**, which checks requirements and contextual policies.

### Validation Flow

1. ViewModel emits `AppNavigationIntent`.
2. Intent is passed to `NavigationChoreographer`.
3. Choreographer runs all validators (sorted by priority).
4. Result is one of:

   * `ValidationResult.Valid` ‚Üí continue navigation.
   * `ValidationResult.Redirect` ‚Üí reroute to another screen.
   * `ValidationResult.Ignore` ‚Üí cancel navigation silently.
   * `ValidationResult.Invalid` ‚Üí stop navigation and show error.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Dialog & Overlay Handling

Dialogs and progress windows extend `AbstractOverlayWindow`. They are:

* **Composable**, reusable, and styleable.
* **Lifecycle-safe** ‚Äî dismissed automatically when host screen exits.
* **Serializable** (if implementing `OverlayMemento`) for process restoration.

Example:

```kotlin
@Immutable
class NetworkErrorDialog(
    private val message: StringResolver,
    override val onDismiss: () -> Unit = {}
) : AbstractDialogWindow(onDismiss) {
    @Composable
    override fun rememberDialogButtons(): ImmutableList<DialogButton> =
        persistentListOf(DialogButton.ok(textResolver = message))
}
```

---

## üß™ Testing

Use provided testing utilities to build and validate navigation graphs in isolation.

```kotlin
runNavigationTest {
    val graph = buildGraph()
    val choreographer = NavigationChoreographer(graph)

    sendIntent(AppNavigationIntent.NavigateTo(HomeScreenRoute()))

    assertCommands(
        NavigationCommand.OpenScreen(HomeScreenRoute())
    )
}
```

## üì¶ Installation

*Coming soon.* Once the library stabilizes, it will be published to Maven Central.

For now, clone and include as a Gradle module:

```kotlin
implementation(project(":navsymphony"))
```

## üß≠ Philosophy

> *"Navigation isn‚Äôt just about screens ‚Äî it‚Äôs about control, context, and correctness."*

NavSymphony is built to scale from simple Compose apps to multi-module embedded systems.
It bridges declarative navigation and enterprise-grade control ‚Äî where **every screen transition is intentional, validated, and safe**.
